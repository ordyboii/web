# Hey, I am Jake üêâ

I am an interaction designer and accessibility advocate.
I have been working at [HMRC]("https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs")
where I help build accessible, interactive services for the UK.

## Work

I have contributed and helped design a lot of services throughout my
career. I have a deep knowledge of interaction and UX design, WCAG
guidelines, accessibility and designing for the right users. Here is a
summary of my work.

### HMRC

**Interaction designer**

From 2023, I joined HMRC, the UK Tax Authority. I have helped design
and test a lot of internal and external services. Most work was done
agile and prototyping was done using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit]("https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/")
in code, also reviewing services using tools like Axe DevTools against the
[WCAG]("https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/") guidelines

### DEF Software

**UX designer**

A software company who provide solutions to local authorities in the
UK, for planning development. From 2020, I led the design of their
main back-office product. During my process, I designed in visual
tools like Adobe CC, but transitioned to C# prototyping. Using this
with the development team to create richer, more accessible designs
for user research.

Throughout my 3 years at [DEF]("https://www.def.co.uk/"), I
designed marketing kits and templates for the consulting staff, led
are-design of the website, led user testing, created working groups
with customers and grew a UX culture within the wider team.
