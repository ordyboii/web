          <h1>Hey, I am Jake 🐉</h1>
          <p>
I am an interaction designer and accessibility advocate.
I have been working at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HMRC</a>
where I help build accessible, interactive services for the UK.
          </p>

          <h2>Work</h2>
          <p>
I have contributed and helped design a lot of services throughout my
career. I have a deep knowledge of interaction and UX design, WCAG
guidelines, accessibility and designing for the right users. Here is a
summary of my work.
          </p>

          <h3>HMRC</h3>
          <strong>Interaction designer</strong>
          <p>
From 2023, I joined HMRC, the UK Tax Authority. I have helped design
and test a lot of internal and external services. Most work was done
agile and prototyping was done using the <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a> in code, also reviewing services using tools like Axe DevTools against the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> guidelines
          </p>

          <h3>DEF Software</h3>
          <strong>UX designer</strong>
          <p>
A software company who provide solutions to local authorities in the
UK, for planning development. From 2020, I led the design of their
main back-office product. During my process, I designed in visual
tools like Adobe CC, but transitioned to C# prototyping. Using this
with the development team to create richer, more accessible designs
for user research.
          </p>
          <p>  
Throughout my 3 years at <a href="https://www.def.co.uk">DEF</a>, I
designed marketing kits and templates for the consulting staff, led
are-design of the website, led user testing, created working groups
with customers and grew a UX culture within the wider team.
